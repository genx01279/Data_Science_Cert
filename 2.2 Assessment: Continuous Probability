# Questions 1 and 2: ACT scores, part 1
# The ACT is a standardized college admissions test used in the United States. The four multi-part questions in this assessment all involve simulating some ACT test scores and answering probability questions about them. For the three year period 2016-2018, ACT standardized test scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. (Real ACT scores are integers between 1 and 36, but we will ignore this detail and use continuous values instead.)
# First we'll simulate an ACT test score dataset and answer some questions about it. Set the seed to 16, then use rnorm() to generate a normal distribution of 10000 tests with a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. Save these values as act_scores. You'll be using this dataset throughout these four multi-part questions.
avg_score <- 20.9
sd_score <- 5.7
set.seed(16, sample.kind = "Rounding")
B <- 10000
act_scores <-  rnorm(B, avg_score, sd_score)

# Question 1a: What is the mean of act_scores? 
mean(act_scores)
# Question 1b: What is the standard deviation of act_scores?
sd(act_scores)
# Question 1c: A perfect score is 36 or greater (the maximum reported score is 36). In act_scores, how many perfect scores are there out of 10,000 simulated tests?
sum(act_scores>=36)
# Question 1d: In act_scores, what is the probability of an ACT score greater than 30?
mean(act_scores >= 30)
# Question 1e: In act_scores, what is the probability of an ACT score less than or equal to 10?
mean(act_scores <= 10)
# Question 2: Set x equal to the sequence of integers 1 to 36. Use dnorm to determine the value of the probability density function over x given a mean of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7; save the result as f_x. Plot x against f_x.
x <- seq(1,36)
f_x <- dnorm(x, avg_score, sd_score)
plot(x, f_x)

# Questions 3 and 4: ACT scores, part 2
#In this 3-part question, you will convert raw ACT scores to Z-scores and answer some questions about them.
# Convert act_scores to Z-scores. Recall from Data Visualization (the second course in this series) that to standardize values (convert values into Z-scores, that is, values distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), you must subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation. Use the mean and standard deviation of act_scores, not the original values used to generate random test scores.
z_scores <- scale(act_scores, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
# Question 3a: What is the probability of a Z-score greater than 2 (2 standard deviations above the mean)?
mean(z_scores > 2)
# Question 3b: What ACT score value corresponds to 2 standard deviations above the mean (Z = 2)?
2*sd(act_scores)+mean(act_scores)
# Question 3c: A Z-score of 2 corresponds roughly to the 97.5th percentile. Use qnorm() to determine the 97.5th percentile of normally distributed data with the mean and standard deviation observed in act_scores. What is the 97.5th percentile of act_scores?
qnorm(0.975, mean(act_scores), sd(act_scores))
# In this 4-part question, you will write a function to create a CDF for ACT scores.
# Write a function that takes a value and produces the probability of an ACT score less than or equal to that value (the CDF). Apply this function to the range 1 to 36.
# Question 4a: What is the minimum integer score such that the probability of that score or lower is at least .95?
cdf <- sapply(1:36, function (x){
  mean(act_scores <= x)
})
min(which(cdf >= .95))
# Question 4b: Use qnorm() to determine the expected 95th percentile, the value for which the probability of receiving that score or lower is 0.95, given a mean score of 20.9 and standard deviation of 5.7. What is the expected 95th percentile of ACT scores?
qnorm(0.95, mean(act_scores), sd(act_scores))
# Question 4c: As discussed in the Data Visualization course, we can use quantile() to determine sample quantiles from the data. Make a vector containing the quantiles for p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01), the 1st through 99th percentiles of the act_scores data. Save these as sample_quantiles. In what percentile is a score of 26?
pnorm(26, mean(act_scores), sd(act_scores))
# Question 4d
# Make a corresponding set of theoretical quantiles using qnorm() over the interval p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01) with mean 20.9 and standard deviation 5.7. Save these as theoretical_quantiles. Make a QQ-plot graphing sample_quantiles on the y-axis versus theoretical_quantiles on the x-axis.
p <- seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)
theoretical_quantiles <- qnorm(p, 20.9, 5.7)
sample_quantitles <- quantile(act_scores, p)
qplot(theoretical_quantiles, sample_quantitles) +geom_abline()
